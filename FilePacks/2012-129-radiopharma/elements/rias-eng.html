        <h3 class="alignCenter subtitle"><strong>REGULATORY IMPACT  ANALYSIS STATEMENT</strong></h3>
        <p class="alignCenter">(<em>This statement is not part of the Regulations</em>.)</p>
        <h4 class="alignLeft subheadline"><strong><em>Executive summary </em></strong></h4>
      <div class="textBoxBlackBorder"><p style="margin-left:6pt;"><strong>Issue:</strong> Health Canada recognizes that basic clinical research using positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals (PERs) is generally considered safe when PERs with known safety profiles are administered in relatively low doses. Currently, the clinical trial regulations in Part C, Division 5 of the <em>Food and Drug Regulations</em> (the Regulations) apply to basic clinical research studies, requiring that a clinical trial application (CTA) be submitted for each study. Both Health Canada and PERs  researchers agree that the CTA framework imposes a greater degree of regulatory oversight than necessary, considering the low potential for harm and low level of uncertainty associated with the majority of PERs research studies.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:6pt;"><strong>Description:</strong> This regulatory amendment introduces a simplified application process for PERs basic clinical research studies that meet the specified inclusion criteria. The new Regulations include provisions respecting the submission of an application, good clinical practices, good manufacturing practices, labelling, record-keeping and adverse reaction reporting. Miscellaneous amendments are also being made to update the wording of the Regulations for consistency with the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> and to correct an error that was introduced in the Regulations in the past.</p>
              <p style="margin-left:6pt;"><strong>Cost-benefit statement: </strong>It is estimated that these amendments will lower the costs associated with conducting PERs basic clinical research in Canada by $2.77M annually, and lead to a better understanding of certain diseases and health conditions. Facilitating research for PERs researchers in Canadian institutions should lead to improved access to this technology for routine diagnostic and treatment purposes.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:6pt;"><strong>Business and consumer impacts: </strong>These amendments will  reduce the complexity of the application process, resulting in a lower cost of conducting basic research. Additionally, under the new Regulations, sponsors will be required to maintain  records for 5 years instead of 25 years as currently required under the clinical trial regulations. No additional costs to consumers or taxpayers are anticipated. </p>              <p style="margin-left:6pt;"><strong>Domestic and international coordination and cooperation: </strong>Although these new Regulations will be implemented in a different manner than those in place in the United States, the  science-based approach to assessing and managing the risk associated with basic research studies will be in line with the U.S. approach. There are no known impacts on international trade agreements or obligations or foreign relations.</p>              <p style="margin-left:6pt;"><strong>Performance measurement and evaluation plan:</strong> The main objective of these amendments is to bring in an appropriate level of regulatory oversight for basic research using PERs while still protecting the health and safety of research subjects. As part of its ongoing performance measurement and evaluation activities, Health Canada will track the number of research studies being conducted with PERs, along with the number of adverse reaction reports received, and changes to the requirements for submission and reporting will be made as needed.</p></div>
        <h4 class="alignLeft subheadline"><em>Issue</em></h4>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The Regulations were amended in 2001 to introduce new provisions in Part C, Division 5, for “Drugs for Clinical Trials Involving Human Subjects.” The definition of “clinical trial” in those Regulations included basic research activities that were previously not regulated under the investigational new drug provisions, and researchers using PERs for basic research clinical studies involving human subjects found their activities being regulated for the first time.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Background</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">A PER is a radioactive drug that is comprised of a positron-emitting radionuclide which has been chemically attached to a biologically active molecule. The PER is administered to a patient, typically by injection, and accumulates in different areas of the body depending on the biological activity of the PER used. The radiation emitted from the PER is detected using a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, producing an image that allows a physician to diagnose or determine the state of a disease.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">A PER can also be used for non-diagnostic purposes, providing information about a patient’s biological function, such as brain or cardiac activity. Many of these studies are considered to be basic clinical research — studies which differ from clinical trials because they are intended to advance scientific knowledge but not intended to fulfil any immediate diagnostic or therapeutic purpose or to obtain any new knowledge about the effects of the PER  itself on study subjects.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The most commonly used PERs have been well characterized and have a history of safe use in humans. PERs are normally  administered in doses so low that no pharmacological effect is observed. Researchers and Health Canada agree that the clinical trial regulations subject many PERs research studies to too much regulatory oversight, considering the relatively low level of risk imposed on study subjects. </p>
        <h4 class="alignLeft subheadline"><em>Objectives</em></h4>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The purpose of these amendments is to provide a streamlined application process for PERs basic clinical research. The new provisions have been added in Part C, Division 3, and any study meeting the inclusion criteria will now be exempted from the clinical trial requirements in Part C, Division 5. The PERs amendments aim to reduce the amount of paperwork required, for both researchers and Health Canada, and are in line with the recommendations of the Government of Canada’s Red Tape Reduction Commission.</p>
        <h4 class="alignLeft subheadline"><em>Description</em></h4>
        <p class="indent-1-0">This regulatory framework is intended to accommodate the specific needs of PERs basic clinical researchers while keeping sufficient checks and balances in place with respect to the safety and quality for the drugs in use and the health and safety of the study subjects. These Regulations outline requirements that must be met before and after the authorization of a basic clinical  research study. Any PER used in these studies needs to have an established history of safe use in humans at the proposed radioactive dose, as supported by published literature and/or evidence from valid human or animal studies. Studies involving the concurrent use of a drug that is not a PER and that has not received marketing authorization from Health Canada will have to be submitted as a CTA as per Part C, Division 5 of the Regulations.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Basic clinical research study</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">A basic clinical research study is an investigation using a PER with a history of safe use in human subjects. A basic clinical research study is intended to obtain</p>
        <ul>
          <li>data on the pharmacokinetics or metabolism of a study drug;</li>
          <li>data on normal human biochemistry or physiology; or</li>
          <li>data on changes caused to human biochemistry or physiology by aging, disease or medical interventions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Basic clinical research studies are aimed at advancing scientific knowledge and are not intended to fulfil any immediate diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">PERs that are used in basic clinical research studies may eventually be authorized for sale in Canada for use in diagnosing and treating diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, but the research study in question is not meant to diagnose or treat the study subjects.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The clinical trial regulations will continue to apply to clinical studies that fall outside the scope defined above — specifically, those studies intended to</p>
        <ul>
          <li>discover or verify the pharmacodynamic effects of the drug;</li>
          <li>identify any adverse events in respect of the drug; or</li>
          <li>ascertain the safety or efficacy of the drug.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Applications for authorization of basic clinical research studies</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Prior to beginning a basic clinical research study using a PER, the sponsor will be required to submit an application to Health Canada, along with a brief summary of the study protocol. The application will then be reviewed by Health Canada to determine whether the study has met the specific requirements outlined in the Regulations.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Research Ethics Board (REB) approval</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The requirements for the membership of an REB are outlined in section C.03.304 of the Regulations.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The principal mandate of the REB, which will operate independently of Health Canada, will be to protect the rights, safety and well-being of basic research subjects. To maintain the integrity of the process, members of the REB may not be affiliated with the sponsor of the study being reviewed. The sponsor will be required to seek REB approval prior to filing an application with Health Canada.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Good clinical practices (GCP</span><span style="text-decoration:underline">s</span><span style="text-decoration:underline">)</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Sponsors of basic clinical research studies using PERs will have to demonstrate that the studies are conducted according  to the generally accepted principles of good clinical practice.  Specifically,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The study must be scientifically sound and clearly described in a protocol that has been approved by an REB.</li>
          <li>For a basic clinical research study to be conducted at multiple sites, each site must have one qualified investigator who is responsible for medical decisions and the medical care of the subjects involved.</li>
          <li>Every individual involved in conducting the study must be qualified by way of education, training and experience to perform his or her respective tasks. </li>
          <li>To protect the safety of the study subjects, each subject must be informed of any potential risks associated with participating in the study. A consent form must be signed prior to the subject’s participation in the study.</li>
          <li>Finally, the sponsor must ensure that all the record-keeping requirements are met, and that PERs are manufactured, handled and stored in accordance with the applicable good manufacturing practices (GMPs) set out in Part C, Division 2 of the Regulations, with the exception of sections C.02.019, C.02.025 and C.02.026, which outline drug product testing and sample retention requirements placed on importers of drugs into Canada.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Good manufacturing practices (GMP</span><span style="text-decoration:underline">s</span><span style="text-decoration:underline">)</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Health Canada recognizes that study drugs, like clinical trial drugs, are not at the same stage of development as drugs which have a market authorization (a Notice of Compliance). Further guidance on GMPs, based on those in place for clinical trial drugs, will be provided to stakeholders by Health Canada.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Labelling</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The sponsor is required to label all PERs used in basic clinical research studies according to the requirements in these  Regulations.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The label of the PERs is to include the following information:</p>
        <ul class="oo-en">
          <li>(<em>a</em>) the unique batch number for the study drug; and<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>(<em>b</em>) the radiation warning symbol set out in Schedule 3 of the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> and the words “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">RAYONNEMENT — DANGER — RADIATION</span>”.
            <br />
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The PER is required to have a package insert providing the following information:</p>
        <ul class="oo-en">
          <li>(<em>a</em>) a statement indicating that the study drug is to be used only under the supervision of a qualified investigator;<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>(<em>b</em>) the chemical or generic name of the study drug;<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>(<em>c</em>) the name and address of the manufacturer;<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>(<em>d</em>) the name and address of the sponsor;<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>(<em>e</em>) the protocol code or identification;<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>(<em>f</em>) the warnings and precautions in respect of the study drug; and<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>(<em>g</em>) the adverse reactions, if any, associated with the study drug.
            <br />
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Records</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The sponsor must keep the records related to the basic clinical research study in a manner that allows for verification during an inspection. Because PERs used in basic research are administered in non-pharmacological doses and at relatively low radiation doses, they are not likely to cause a delayed or long-term adverse reaction, so the required period for records retention is 5 years  for PERs research studies, compared to the previously required  25-year period under the clinical trial regulations.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Additionally, the sponsor will retain a letter of undertaking, signed and dated by the qualified investigator prior to the commencement of their responsibilities, stating that the qualified investigator will conduct the basic clinical research study in accordance with GCPs. The qualified investigator must further commit to informing the study subjects and the REB of the termination of a basic clinical research study when the reason for discontinuance is related to the health or safety of study subjects. </p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Notice of adverse reactions</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Because the rate of adverse reactions to PERs used in the manner outlined in these Regulations is expected to be very low, any adverse reaction would be deemed unexpected and would have to be reported to Health Canada. In the event of a serious adverse reaction leading to a fatality or a life-threatening condition, the sponsor must notify the Minister within 7 days after becoming aware of the information. For an adverse reaction that did not result in death or was not considered life-threatening, the sponsor is required to notify the Minister within 15 days after becoming aware of the information.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Within 8 days after having notified the Minister of a serious adverse reaction, the sponsor must submit a complete report of the reaction, including an assessment of the importance and implication of the findings made.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Miscellaneous amendments</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Miscellaneous amendments have also been made to update the wording of the Regulations for consistency with the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> and to correct an error that was introduced in the Regulations in the past, as follows:</p>
        <p class="indent-1-1">(1) The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), the federal authority regulating the use of nuclear energy and materials to protect health, safety, security and the environment, developed the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> in 2000, which replaced the <em>Atomic Energy Control Regulations</em>. As a result, the references in subparagraph C.03.202(1)(<em>b</em>)(vi) and paragraph C.03.203(1)(<em>f</em>) of the Regulations have now been  updated to bring them in line with the wording used by the CNSC; and</p>
        <p class="indent-1-1">(2) The reference to item 7 of Schedule B to the <em>Food and Drugs Act</em> (the Act) in subsections C.03.204(1) and (2) of the <em>Regulations</em> is replaced by a reference to item 8 of Schedule B to the Act to correct an error that was introduced earlier.</p>
        <h4 class="alignLeft subheadline"><em>Regulatory and non-regulatory options considered</em></h4>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The options outlined below were considered in the development of this new regulatory framework:</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">1. Keep basic research under clinical trial regulations</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The situation in which researchers had to file a CTA for every basic clinical research study involving a PER was not deemed to be a viable option. Both Health Canada and external stakeholders agreed that the level of detail required for a CTA was not appropriate for basic clinical research studies with PERs. By regulating basic research studies in a manner proportionate to the level of risk involved, unnecessary paperwork burden will be eliminated, and researchers will be able to focus on the advancement of  science.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">2. Independent body to review PERs basic clinical research applications</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">In the United States, regulations require that each institution have a Radioactive Drug Research Committee, which reviews and approves proposed research studies involving radioactive drugs in humans. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) appoints members of these committees. The main advantage to this approach is that the oversight of basic clinical research studies is delegated to a research committee within the institution, thus decreasing the burden on the regulatory body in the assessment of these lower-risk activities.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">After consulting with stakeholders, it was decided that the regulatory approach used by the FDA could not work in Canada. Due to the small number of qualified specialists in this area, it would be difficult to form a review committee that is not, in some way, associated with the proposed basic clinical research study being reviewed. In addition, having a local committee of PERs experts review and give final approval to basic clinical research studies would have added to the administrative burden on the limited number of researchers in this field, something that Health Canada was trying to reduce.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">3. No regulation of basic clinical research using PERs</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Prior to September 2001, when the current clinical trial regulations came into effect, most PERs used in basic clinical research studies would have been classified as Investigational New Drugs (INDs) if the PER were shipped off-site to another facility or if the sponsor was a private clinic. However, if the PER had been manufactured for on-site use, then an IND submission would not have been required because it would have been considered practice of pharmacy (compounding) / practice of medicine. Because of this history, most stakeholders believed that any sort of regulation of studies involving PERs was unnecessary.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">In recent years, many stakeholders have come to agree that a certain level of regulation is prudent. The rationale for regulating these basic clinical research studies is that PERs are drugs as defined in the Act, and there are certain risk factors involved in the administration of any drug to human subjects. Drugs that have not been evaluated in terms of quality, safety and efficacy may place human subjects at unknown risk. Although commonly used PERs have an excellent safety record, PERs are not always free of adverse reactions. The new Regulations balance the need to protect the health and safety of study subjects with the well-accepted safety record of these of drugs.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">4. Introduction of a new regulatory framework for the use of PERs for in basic clinical research studies</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The new regulatory framework takes into account</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the known safety profiles of commonly used PERs and their unique characteristics;</li>
          <li>the assessment and management of the risk to which human research subjects are exposed;</li>
          <li>the size and nature of the affected basic research community;</li>
          <li>the existence of established infrastructure associated with basic clinical research studies with PERs and the costs of maintaining such infrastructure;</li>
          <li>the potential for continued scientific advancements through the use of PERs in basic research studies in the future; and</li>
          <li>the models of review used by regulatory authorities from other countries.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The simplified application process for PERs for basic clinical research takes into consideration both the concerns of researchers and the responsibility that lies with Health Canada as the regulator of drugs.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">After consideration of the above proposals, Option 4 was  chosen as the preferred alternative.</p>
        <h4 class="alignLeft subheadline"><em>Benefits and costs</em></h4>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The chosen option will result in the following benefits and costs. They are presented below according to sector.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sponsors</span></p>
        <p class="alignLeft">Benefits</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The new regulatory framework encourages scientists in the field to continue their research in Canada by decreasing the regulatory burden placed on them. These amendments will facilitate scientific research, which may lead to advances in diagnosing and treating diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and cancer. A PER studied in a basic research study may one day become an invaluable diagnostic tool in detecting molecular changes in human biochemistry or physiology in diseases, which are pre-symptomatic, thereby leading to prevention of and early intervention in certain diseases.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The expertise required to navigate the present CTA process may have required the sponsor to hire a contract research organization or a regulatory affairs consultant. These amendments will reduce the complexity of the application process, reducing the amount of supporting information required. This should result in decreased costs to sponsors, with an estimated total savings of $2.77M each year for PERs researchers across Canada.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Under the new Regulations, the paperwork burden is being reduced for sponsors, but the risks to study subjects are still being managed. Record-keeping requirements will be brought in line with the actual risks posed to study subjects, with a reduction in the record retention period from 25 years under the clinical trial provisions to 5 years in the new framework.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft">Costs</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Sponsors are not expected to incur any additional costs as a result of these new Regulations. </p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Regulator</span></p>
        <p class="alignLeft">Benefits</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The resources needed to review a streamlined application for a basic clinical research study will be decreased compared to the resources required to process a CTA.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft">Costs</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">There are no additional costs to government associated with compliance and enforcement because the existing clinical trial audit program in the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate will continue to apply to PER sites.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Public</span></p>
        <p class="alignLeft">Benefits</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Positron emission tomography (PET) is among the most innovative in vivo imaging techniques and is used during the initial diagnostic evaluation of patients to monitor and predict therapeutic effectiveness. Human research studies have demonstrated that using PERs in early PET scanning detects abnormalities in early disease development significantly earlier than other diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, ultrasound and X-ray examination.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">As the medical treatment of diseases shifts to community-based care, PERs are expected to be an invaluable diagnostic and treatment tool that will provide patients with a higher level of healthcare by accessing medical knowledge in a non-invasive manner (as opposed to surgeries), thereby avoiding surgical complications and prolonged hospitalizations. The removal of unnecessary regulatory requirements will allow more basic clinical research studies and will likely improve Canadians’ access to PET scans for diagnosis and treatment purposes.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft">Costs</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The public should not incur any additional costs due to these new Regulations.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Provincial and territorial governments</span></p>
        <p class="alignLeft">Benefits</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">As medical treatment shifts from inpatient hospital stays to community-based care, more widespread use of PET as a diagnostic tool will allow health professionals to provide a high level of health care for a variety of diseases in a non-surgical, non-invasive manner. The use of PERs might reduce post-surgery complications, prolonged hospitalizations and long recovery  periods, thus reducing the financial costs associated with hospitalizations. A strong PERs basic research program in a particular institution may accelerate the adoption of PET for diagnostic purposes, thereby allowing some of these benefits to be realized.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft">Costs</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Provincial and territorial governments should not expect to  incur any additional costs due to these amendments.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Research ethics boards (REBs)</span></p>
        <p class="alignLeft">Benefits</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The responsibility of REBs with respect to PERs basic clinical research studies will remain the same as their responsibilities to oversee clinical trials under the clinical trial regulations. The  sequence has changed, though, and the REB will now be asked to review and approve the basic clinical research study prior to the sponsor’s submission of an application to Health Canada. </p>
        <p class="alignLeft">Costs</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">These Regulations may result in an increased number of PERs basic clinical research studies conducted which may lead to an increased workload for REBs.</p>
        <h4 class="alignLeft subheadline"><em>Rationale</em></h4>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The new regulatory framework for PERs basic clinical research studies brings the extent of regulatory oversight to a level that is more appropriate for these low-risk studies. These amendments are intended to lead to lower administrative costs, and the knowledge gained from using PERs as a research tool will result in a greater understanding of certain diseases and health conditions.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">No additional costs to the Canadian public are expected.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">These regulatory requirements address concerns about over-regulation and bring Canadian regulations in line with those in place in the United States. Fostering an active, robust PERs research community will help ensure that Canadians have access to PET technology, which is an important tool in both diagnostics and scientific/medical research.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Because of the significant difference in the size of the PERs research communities in Canada and the United States, complete regulatory harmonization is not possible, but the new Regulations align Canadian requirements with those used by the United States regulator, in terms of both risk management and extent of regulatory paperwork burden.</p>
        <h4 class="alignLeft subheadline"><em>Consultation</em></h4>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prior to prepublication</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">From 2002 to 2009, Health Canada consulted with PERs stakeholders a number of times in order to understand and address their concerns respecting the clinical trial regulations. There were two mail-out campaigns to solicit feedback on policy documents, and two working group meetings were held to discuss technical issues around the use of PERs in clinical trials and in research settings. Many provisions within the new Regulations were derived from discussions held with PERs stakeholders.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">A full description of consultations held prior to 2009 can be found on pages 727–28 of the March 21, 2009, issue of the <em>Canada Gazette</em>, Part Ⅰ.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Comment period following prepublication in March 2009</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Following prepublication of these draft Regulations, 14 stakeholder letters were submitted within the 75-day comment period. </p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">One stakeholder was very supportive of the new framework and commented that the changes would work very well within the institution where his research was conducted.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Ten stakeholders expressed concern about the requirements for the basic research application contained within the Regulations. Many stated that the requirements appeared to be as onerous as, if not more so than, those for a CTA. Clarification has been provided to stakeholders, informing them that the simplified application form is a checklist to which the sponsor must attest and that much of the required supporting information need not be submitted to Health Canada.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Eight comments were received expressing concern over the application of GMPs to the manufacture of PERs for basic clinical research studies, citing high costs as a prohibitive barrier to researchers’ ability to move into compliance with the existing GMP annex for market-authorized PERs. Health Canada will be issuing a guidance document that outlines modified GMP requirements based on those in place for clinical trial drugs. As is done for all guidance documents under development, stakeholders will have an opportunity to comment on revised GMP requirements prior to the release of the finalized document.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Two stakeholders commented that the CNSC already has guidelines in place for research involving human subjects. Although there are a small number of overlapping requirements, the CNSC framework focuses mainly on the safety of the research subject with respect to radiation exposure, whereas the PERs  basic research provisions in the <em>Food and Drug Regulations</em> focus on clinical safety and drug quality. The requirements of both frameworks are well aligned so that stakeholders will be able to meet the requirements of both without difficulty.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Ten letters contained comments regarding the limit of 30 study subjects, with stakeholders expressing concerns that, for some studies, a 30-subject cap would not provide sufficient data for statistically meaningful results. Many studies are adequately powered by a sample size of 30, which is the recommended maximum cited in the United States guidance document on the use of radioactive drugs in human research. Health Canada has addressed stakeholder concerns by adding a provision to allow for larger studies if an acceptable scientific rationale is provided. This requirement is in line with that which is in place in the United States.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Two stakeholders remarked on the extent of the labelling requirements for PERs for basic clinical research. The requirements, based on those in the CTA framework in Part C, Division 5 of the Regulations, have been included in this framework to protect the safety of study subjects involved in the basic research study. After careful consideration of stakeholder concerns, Health Canada opted to keep the labelling provisions in place.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Four stakeholders commented that a PER being used for basic research will not likely have a brand name. The Regulations have been changed to address this concern.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Two stakeholders commented that the requirement for the drug to be returned and destroyed upon discontinuation of the study is not applicable to PERs, the handling of which is regulated by the CNSC. The wording of this requirement has been changed.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Two stakeholders raised a concern that, if a study were to be terminated, the requirement for notification of the study subjects would raise unnecessary concern among individuals who most likely would not be affected. This provision was reworded to require notification of subjects only in cases where the study was terminated for safety-related reasons.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Five stakeholders commented about the composition and function of the REB. The requirements for membership of the REB for PERs basic research is based on the provisions in the clinical trial framework in Part C, Division 5, of the Regulations. In the new PERs framework, minimal information will actually be submitted for review by Health Canada, so the Regulations stipulate that REB approval must be sought prior to the filing of an application with Health Canada. Note that pre-approval by an REB will facilitate efficient review times within Health Canada — it is anticipated that staff should be able to meet the 15-day service standard consistently.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Ten stakeholders expressed concern about the limit of 20 mSv for annual total exposure for study subjects. Researchers stated that this limit would exclude many cancer patients because of the doses previously administered as part of their radiation therapy, and they advocated for a limit of 50 mSv (the annual limit set by CNSC for at-risk workers) for cancer patients. Health Canada’s scientists were not convinced of this argument, and their stance on this subject remained unchanged after the initial review of the prepublication comments.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Five stakeholders expressed concern over the wording of the provisions regarding pregnancy testing of female subjects and exclusion of lactating women from the basic research studies. The wording has been changed to clarify the conditions under which pregnancy testing would be required, and the provision regarding lactation has been amended to bring requirements in line with current scientific knowledge.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Stakeholders submitted other comments respecting other aspects of the new regulatory framework, but those comments that were not addressed above did not require changes to the Regulations and will be addressed at the guidance level. As per standard practice for guidance development, Health Canada will provide stakeholders with an opportunity to comment on a draft version prior to the finalization of the document.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Call letter — September 2011</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">As part of its ongoing stakeholder communications, Health Canada sent a letter to radiopharmaceutical stakeholders to solicit general comments regarding ongoing regulatory projects in September 2011. Two letters were received regarding the changes respecting PERs basic research.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The first stakeholder requested clarification with respect to the function of REBs in the PERs basic research framework. The relevant section of this document was revised to address the comment.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The second letter requested clarification regarding the use of a PER as a tracer in a clinical trial for another (non-PER) drug; the requirements related to adverse reaction reporting; and the GMP requirements for the manufacture of study drugs. These issues did not require changes to the Regulations and will be addressed at the guidance level.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Also, following the issuance of this call letter, discussions between Health Canada and several members of an umbrella stakeholder group highlighted some confusion among PERs researchers respecting the interim requirements that were in place during the period of policy development and stakeholder consultation and the changes that would come with the finalization of the new regulatory framework for PERs research. In an attempt to provide clarity, Health Canada produced a “Questions and Answers” document that was distributed to stakeholders by email in December 2011.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Regulatory workshop for radiopharmaceutical stakeholders — March 2012</span></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Health Canada hosted a workshop in Ottawa for radiopharmaceutical stakeholders on March 8 and 9, 2012. Health Canada staff gave presentations to participants from the scientific, academic, healthcare and commercial sectors of the radiopharmaceutical community. A variety of topics were covered, including these new Regulations for PERs basic clinical research. While a number of different issues were discussed, one main issue dominated the two-day workshop.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The topic of limiting the annual total radiation dose to 20 mSv continued to be at the forefront of researchers’ concerns at this meeting. The face-to-face forum provided a good opportunity for a productive exchange of information between the regulator and the regulated stakeholders. In the end, Health Canada agreed that, based on the most recent scientific information available, the  50 mSv/year limit set out in the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em> as the maximum allowable radiation dose for nuclear workers would also be a suitable limit for study subjects.</p>
        <h4 class="alignLeft subheadline"><em>Implementation, enforcement and service standards </em></h4>
        <p class="indent-1-0">These amendments do not alter existing compliance mechanisms under the provisions of the Act and Regulations enforced by the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate. Inspections, compliance verification and investigations of basic clinical research studies will be conducted to ensure that GCPs and the applicable GMPs are followed.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Health Canada will aim to process applications for authorization for PERs basic clinical research studies within 15 days of receipt.</p>
        <h4 class="alignLeft subheadline"><em>Performance measurement and evaluation</em></h4>
        <p class="indent-1-0">An evaluation of these Regulations will be carried out five years after implementation of the framework.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">A central objective of these Regulations is to reduce the unnecessary regulatory burden on researchers who conduct basic research using PERs. The regulatory requirements and process which are usually associated with clinical trials have been modified for this specific type of research. Assessment and management of risks to human subjects have remained central in the development of these Regulations.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">As a result, evaluation and performance measures will focus on the safety of the basic clinical research subjects, as well as on evidence that the regulatory burden has been reduced for researchers conducting basic clinical research using PERs. The broader implications of these Regulations for PERs basic research in Canada will be considered, including whether or not a reduction in regulatory burden has had the desired effect of supporting and enhancing basic research in Canada.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Measures of research subject safety will be addressed up front through the application process and in the post-approval period through the monitoring of adverse events and inspection reports. Where appropriate, current clinical trial requirements and application review times will be used as a basis for comparison (e.g. estimated 50% reduction in review time for PERs basic research applications as compared with clinical trials). Change in the number of successful PERs basic research applications (over a three- to five-year period) would provide an indication of overall impact on researchers, as will feedback from key stakeholders.</p>
